## About the project

The goal of this project is to simulate basic physics interactions, and combinations of them.

Example 1- Newton's second law of motion. User inputs 2/3 variables, and gets a visual representation of the law in action.

Example 2- An object falling down on a slope. User inputs TBD variables (e.g. gravity, angle of slope...) and gets a visual representation.

Example 3- Temperature differences. User sees a visualised "outside" and "indoors" sections, where a square, simulating the "indoors room" is a delimeter. User uses a provided input method to "warm up" the room, sets the thermal isolation level of the square and sees how the higher temperature leaves the inside of square.

Currently the project is in the first stages of development and planning, and is not ready to be used/contributed to by other developers. One of the far-future goals is isolating the created "physics engine", and using it to make a small-scale game engine.
